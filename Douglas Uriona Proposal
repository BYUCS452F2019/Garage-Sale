Iâ€™m interested in your project since I believe that your project will be a good learning experience in terms of creating a database. Also it sounds like it will be a good real-world experience in terms of creating something applicable. Another reason why I would like to join your group is because I have worked with you before on projects and I know your work ethic. I would like to contribute with the backend portion which is just setting up and creating the database as I would like to gain more experience in this. Reading over your business, technical, and legal portions of your pitch has convinced me even more to join your team. Especially seeing the priorities of the technical aspect of the project.
