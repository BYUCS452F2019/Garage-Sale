I'm interested in working on the team for your project because of the usefulness of the idea, and I believe it could be very beneficial
to students. I would like to contribute with either the front or back end of the application, whichever I am needed on. Since the 
business aspect of the project would include money transactions, I'm interested in learning how to handle the development of 
that feature and how to secure that sensitive data. In general I believe I can learn a lot from working on this project, 
especially with the real life aspects like the legal aspect, which I don't have much experience with. I have some previous 
experience working with full stack applications, and I'm hoping to gain more experience here.
