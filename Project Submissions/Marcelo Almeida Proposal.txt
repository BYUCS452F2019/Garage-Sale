I am interested on this project because I liked the idea. I believe selling stuff online is really complicated and there are a lot of scammers, I believe we could create a good secure system together. I have experience with front and back end. I have been working the last two years as a Mobile developer in Salt Lake and most of my experience is front end. But I also had to do the entire server of CS340 by myself. So, I have full-stack experience for this project and I can do whatever.
